  Features

- **Dynamic Themes**: The Tetris game changes its appearance randomly.

- **Special Spin Penalties**: When a player performs a spin in multiplayer mode, a special penalty is applied to other players, temporarily increasing the gravity and making their pieces fall faster.
- **Line Clear Penalties**: In multiplayer mode, clearing more than one line at a time sends penalties to other players. The number of lines sent is equal to the number cleared minus one, and these penalty lines are indestructible.

- **Spectator View**: Players can view the "ghost pieces" or specters of other players' boards in multiplayer mode.
- **Room Master System**: The first player to connect to a room becomes the master and is the only one who can start the game. If the master leaves the room, another player is automatically assigned as the new master.
- **Joining Ongoing Games**: If a player joins a game already in progress, they will need to refresh the page after the game ends to rejoin the room.
